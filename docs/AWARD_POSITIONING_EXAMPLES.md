## Cover Letter Generation Examples

### Example 1: Startup Application

> I'm excited to apply for the Senior Product Manager role at [Startup]. Your need to ship fast with limited engineering resources resonates deeply with my approach—which earned me Skillshare's Agility Award for "making the most of resources" and delivering "right-sized solutions to complex problems." I've built 0-to-1 products like the ChatGPT App, driven 25% engagement increases through scrappy Algolia experiments, and pioneered AI-first features, all while navigating pivots and resource constraints. I don't wait for perfect conditions—I ship, learn, and iterate.

**Why This Works:**

- ✅ Directly addresses startup pain points (limited resources)
- ✅ Shows 0-to-1 capability
- ✅ "Don't wait for perfect conditions" = high agency

**Body Paragraph Example:**

> At Skillshare, I was tasked with improving content discovery but had limited engineering capacity. Rather than waiting for a full platform rebuild, I deployed quick Crazy Egg CTAs to validate hypotheses and ran scrappy experiments using our existing Algolia integration. This approach—cited in my Agility Award recognition—delivered a 25% increase in daily engagement within weeks, not months. I excel at finding creative, right-sized solutions that deliver user value fast, which is exactly what [Startup] needs at this stage.
