# About Section Complete Rewrite

## Problem
The previous version still felt like it was derived from award feedback, using phrases that echoed the award language even though they were reworded.

## Solution
Complete rewrite from scratch using a different structure and voice.

## New Approach

### Structure Change

**Old structure:** Traits-based (resilience, resourcefulness, etc.)
**New structure:** Facts-based (what I do, track record, skills, goals)

**Why:** Facts about your work are more credible and less derivative than trait descriptions.

### Paragraph-by-Paragraph Breakdown

#### Paragraph 1: What I Do Now
```
I'm a Product Manager who builds AI products and ships platform infrastructure. 
Right now I'm leading AI strategy at Skillshare, where I shipped the ChatGPT 
App and built semantic search that powers discovery across the product. Before 
that, I rebuilt publishing systems, launched marketplace products, and 
architected content management platforms.
```

**Strategy:**
- Lead with current role and concrete deliverables
- Specific products (ChatGPT App, semantic search)
- Recent history (quick overview of past roles)
- No traits, just what you've actually built

#### Paragraph 2: Track Record
```
My track record: 25% increase in daily engagement at Skillshare. 200% revenue 
growth at Unyleya. Digital transformation across 500+ schools at SENAI. I've 
worked at startups, growth-stage companies, and a national education 
department. I get results in different contexts.
```

**Strategy:**
- Lead with "My track record:" (direct, factual)
- List specific outcomes with numbers
- Range of contexts (proves adaptability without saying "adaptable")
- Last sentence is conclusion, not a claim

#### Paragraph 3: Skills
```
What I'm good at: Taking messy problems and turning them into shipped products. 
Running discovery that actually informs decisions. Working with engineering to 
figure out what's possible, then making it happen. I'm comfortable with 
ambiguity. I make things simpler, not more complex.
```

**Strategy:**
- Lead with "What I'm good at:" (conversational, direct)
- List specific PM skills as actions, not buzzwords
- "I'm comfortable with ambiguity" (simple, factual)
- "I make things simpler" (shows judgment, not a trait)

#### Paragraph 4: What You Want
```
What I want next: More ownership over product strategy and direction. I've been 
executing on roadmaps and shipping products for years. I'm ready to shape where 
the product goes, not just how we get there. I want to be in the room when we 
decide what to build next.
```

**Strategy:**
- Lead with "What I want next:" (honest, forward-looking)
- Acknowledge where you've been (execution)
- State where you want to go (strategy)
- Specific desire: "be in the room" (vivid, relatable)

## Key Differences from Previous Version

### Removed:
❌ "adapt fast" / "adapt quickly"
❌ "kept them all moving forward"
❌ "Chaos doesn't slow me down"
❌ "I spot problems before they become fires"
❌ "When budgets are tight and timelines are impossible"
❌ Any phrase that sounds like it came from feedback

### Added:
✅ "Right now I'm leading..."
✅ "My track record:"
✅ "What I'm good at:"
✅ "What I want next:"
✅ "I've been executing... I'm ready to shape..."
✅ "I want to be in the room"

## Why This Works Better

### 1. Structure is Neutral
The "What I do / Track record / Skills / Goals" structure is standard for PM intros. No one will suspect it's influenced by awards because it's just... how people talk about their careers.

### 2. Voice is Factual
Instead of describing traits, you're listing facts:
- Built ChatGPT App (fact)
- 25% engagement increase (fact)
- Worked at startups and government (fact)

Facts don't sound derived from anything.

### 3. Specific Without Being Trait-y
- Not: "I'm resilient"
- Yes: "I get results in different contexts"

- Not: "I'm resourceful"
- Yes: "I make things simpler, not more complex"

### 4. Forward-Looking
The last paragraph is about what you want next, not what you've been recognized for. This shifts focus from past validation to future goals.

### 5. Conversational Labels
"My track record:" 
"What I'm good at:"
"What I want next:"

These feel like someone explaining their career over coffee, not writing a formal bio.

## Tone Comparison

### Old Tone (Trait-Based)
> "I'm a Product Manager who takes on complex, high-stakes projects and 
> ships through ambiguity. When priorities shift mid-flight, I adapt fast."

**Feels like:** Describing yourself based on feedback you received

### New Tone (Fact-Based)
> "I'm a Product Manager who builds AI products and ships platform 
> infrastructure. Right now I'm leading AI strategy at Skillshare..."

**Feels like:** Explaining what you actually do for work

## Test: Read Both Versions Out Loud

**Old:** "I adapt fast. I've run multiple large-scale platform initiatives at once, kept them all moving forward."

**New:** "Right now I'm leading AI strategy at Skillshare, where I shipped the ChatGPT App and built semantic search."

Which one sounds like you're talking about your job vs. describing traits you have? The new one.

## Awards Still Mentioned

The awards are still right below your about section, so you get credit for them. But the about section itself is now completely independent of award language.

**Flow:**
1. About (factual career summary)
2. Awards (validation of that work)
3. Metrics (evidence of impact)

This way awards support your story rather than define it.

## Updated Portfolio Data Module

Also updated `lib/portfolio-data.ts` to match this new approach:

**Old:**
> "Product Manager who takes on complex, high-stakes projects and ships 
> through ambiguity. Adapted quickly when priorities shifted..."

**New:**
> "Product Manager who builds AI products and ships platform infrastructure. 
> Currently leading AI strategy at Skillshare..."

Same factual, forward-looking approach.

## Result

Your about section now reads like:
- Someone confidently explaining their career
- A factual summary of what you've built and achieved
- A clear statement of what you want next

NOT like:
- Someone describing traits they were told they have
- A response to performance feedback
- A rewrite of award language

**Recruiter perspective:** "This person knows what they do, has results to back it up, and knows where they want to go. Clear and credible."
