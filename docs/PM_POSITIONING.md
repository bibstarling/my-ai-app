## Interview Talking Points

### "Tell me about yourself"
```
I'm a scrappy, execution-focused PM who thrives in ambiguity. My teams 
describe me as someone who "makes the most of resources" and delivers 
"right-sized solutions to complex problems"—which earned me Skillshare's 
Agility Award.

I've built 0-to-1 products like the ChatGPT App, driven 25% engagement 
increases through creative experiments, and pioneered AI-first features. 
What I love most is turning constraints into advantages and shipping fast 
in uncertain environments.
```

### "What's your product philosophy?"
```
Ship fast, learn fast, iterate fast. I don't believe in waiting for perfect 
conditions. I'd rather run a scrappy Algolia experiment and learn in a week 
than spend months on the "perfect" solution.

My approach: Find creative ways to validate quickly with existing tools, 
align cross-functional teams around user value, and maintain velocity 
through pivots and uncertainty.
```

### "Tell me about a time you had limited resources"
```
This is where I excel. At Skillshare, I was tasked with improving content 
discovery but had limited engineering resources. Instead of waiting for a 
full rebuild, I ran scrappy experiments using Algolia, deployed quick 
Crazy Egg CTAs, and combined existing tools creatively.

Result: 25% increase in daily engagement. Leadership recognized this with 
the Agility Award for "making the most of resources" and delivering user 
value quickly.
```

## Bottom Line

**You're not just another PM.** You're the PM companies hire when they need to:
- Ship something from nothing (0-to-1)
- Move fast with limited resources
- Navigate ambiguity and pivots
- Experiment and learn quickly
- Drive measurable impact

**Your profile says:** "I'll figure it out and ship it, whatever it takes."

**That's incredibly valuable.** Own it.
