- Could confuse hiring managers about focus area

### ✅ Kept: Bachelor in Product Design & Graphic Design
**Why this is valuable:**
- **Product Design** directly relates to Product Management
- Shows design thinking and user-centric approach
- Demonstrates cross-functional capabilities
- UX/Design background is highly valued in PM roles
- Helps communicate with design teams
- Shows understanding of user experience

**ATS Keywords:** Product Design, Graphic Design, User Experience

### ✅ Added: Mechatronics Engineering (Coursework)
**Why this is highly valuable for PM roles:**

#### Technical Credibility
- Shows engineering foundation
- Demonstrates analytical thinking
- Proves ability to understand technical systems
- Helps earn respect from engineering teams

#### Coding Background
- **Critical for AI/ML PM roles**
- Understands technical feasibility
- Can review code and architecture decisions
- Speaks "engineer language"
- Better estimation and planning

#### Competitive Advantage
- Many PMs lack technical depth
- Engineering coursework differentiates you
- Especially valuable for:
  - AI/ML Product Management
  - Technical infrastructure products
  - Developer tools
  - Platform products

#### "Incomplete" is Fine
- Common for successful PMs

foundation for leading AI/ML product development"

### Technical Platform PM
**High Value (8/10)**
- Need to understand architecture
- Work closely with engineers
- Make technical tradeoff decisions
- Engineering background highly valued

### Consumer Product PM
**Medium Value (6/10)**
- Less technical depth needed
- Still valuable for:
  - Understanding technical constraints
  - Planning with engineering
  - Evaluating feasibility

### Growth/Marketing PM
**Medium Value (5/10)**
- Less directly relevant
- Still shows analytical thinking
- Demonstrates technical aptitude

## Positioning Strategy

### Emphasize When:
- Applying to technical PM roles
- AI/ML positions
- Platform or infrastructure products
- Engineering-heavy companies
- Startups needing technical PMs

### De-emphasize When:
- Non-technical product roles
- Heavy business/operations focus
- Marketing product positions
- Roles where design is primary skill

## Interview Talking Points

### When Asked About Education

**Strong Answer:**
"I started in Mechatronics Engineering where I learned programming and 
systems thinking, then transitioned to Product Design where I developed 
user-centric thinking. This combination gives me a unique perspective - 
I understand both the technical constraints engineers face and the design 
principles that create great user experiences. It's why I'm effective at 
bridging engineering and design teams."

**Key Points:**
- Started technical, added design
- Combination is strength
- Bridge between teams
- User-centric with technical depth

### When Asked About Technical Skills

**Strong Answer:**
"My engineering coursework gave me a foundation in programming and algorithms. 
While I don't code daily, I can review technical designs, understand 
architecture decisions, and have meaningful technical conversations with 
engineers. This helps me make better product decisions around feasibility, 
complexity, and technical debt."

**Key Points:**
- Foundation, not active coder
- Can engage technically
- Informs product decisions
- Practical application

## ATS Optimization

### Keywords Added
From Mechatronics Engineering:
- Engineering
- Programming
- Algorithms
- Systems Design
- Technical Foundation
- Coursework

### Match Improvement
**Before:** Education shows only design background
**After:** Education shows design + technical foundation

**Impact:**
- Better match for technical PM roles
- Stronger ATS scores for AI/ML positions
- More competitive for engineering-heavy companies

### Example Job Description Match

**Job Requirement:**
"Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or related field preferred"

**Your Profile:**
✅ Product Design (related field - product management focus)
✅ Mechatronics Engineering coursework (engineering background)

## Common Questions

### Q: Will "incomplete" hurt my chances?
**A:** No! Many successful PMs have incomplete STEM degrees. What matters:
- You gained technical knowledge
- You can apply it to PM work
- You show intellectual curiosity
- Combined with PM experience, it's a strength

### Q: Should I explain why I didn't complete it?
**A:** Only if asked. Good answer:
"I discovered my passion for product management and transitioned to Product 
Design, but the engineering foundation has been invaluable in my PM career, 
especially for technical product work."

### Q: How technical do I need to be as a PM?
**A:** Depends on role:
- AI/ML PM: Need to understand ML concepts, data pipelines
- Platform PM: Understand architecture, APIs, scalability
- Consumer PM: Understand frontend, UX, analytics
- Your engineering coursework covers these fundamentals

### Q: Should I list specific courses?
**A:** For resumes, keep general:
"Programming, algorithms, and systems design coursework"

For LinkedIn, you can add more detail:
"Relevant coursework: C Programming, Data Structures, Algorithms, 
Digital Systems, Robotics, Control Systems"

## Recommendations

### On Resume
- List both degrees
